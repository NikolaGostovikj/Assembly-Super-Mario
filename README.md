# Super Mario Minigame in Assembly (16-bit Simulator)

Welcome to the Super Mario Minigame, built entirely using Assembly for a 16-bit simulator! This project incorporates several key features of a retro platformer, such as:

- **Horizontal Scrolling (Hscroll)**
- **Sprites**
- **Interrupt Handling**
- **Text Mode**
- **Collision Detection**

## How to Run

1. **Open the Simulator**: [Click here to access the Assembly 16-bit Simulator](https://parraman.github.io/asm-simulator/) (All credits go to the creator).
2. **Set Speed**: Set the speed to **50KHz** for optimal performance.
3. **Assemble & Run**: Click the **Assemble** button and then hit **Run** to start the game.
4. **Controls**:
   - **Move Left**: Press `4`
   - **Move Right**: Press `6`

## Game Features

- **Mario vs. Goomba**: You control Mario as he moves across the screen. There's a **collision detection** system in place, allowing you to defeat the Goomba character when Mario jumps on it.
- **Collision** Goomba can beat Mario if Mario doesn't jump **above/on** Goomba. 
- **End Goal**: After progressing a certain distance through horizontal scrolling, you can capture a **flag** to end the game.

## Enjoy!
